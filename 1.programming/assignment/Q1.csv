2. I think it's interesting how all of these have a high pay, but some of them like aerospace testers is lower than
atmospheric scientists. The amount of jobs in say Software Developers is also crazy high compared to other jobs
like atmospheric scientists.
3. Software Developers, Computer Hardware Engineers, Computer Programmers, Aerospace Engineers, Data Scientist,
Computer Research Scientist, Atmospheric Scientists, Aerospace Testers
Mainly was a factor of how interested I am in the job,
I'm more interested in CS and also want a better paying + open job.
